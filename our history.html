              The <span style="color:blueviolet">Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ (PHJC) </span>was founded in a village
              called Dernbach in the diocese of
              <span style="color:blueviolet"> Limburg, Germany on August 15, 1851 by St. Katharina Kasper</span> .
              Katharina was born in a peasant family whose
              parents were Henry Kasper and Katharina Fasal from Dernbach, Westerwald, Germany. They had eight children
              and Katharina was the 7th child. Though she was a peasant girl with only primary education she was endowed
              with a clear insight and strong determination and whose characteristic feature is expressed in her motto
              taken from the book “Imitation of Christ”: “Love to be unknown and esteemed as nothing.”
              <br> <br>
              Jesus continually calls people to participate in a unique way in his redemptive mission. This is how Mary
              Katharina Kasper even as a child understood herself to be called to imitate Christ who was humble obedient
              to fulfil the will of God.
              <br> <br>
              In prayer and faithfully following the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Katharina experienced her vocation to
              such handmaid service. Her example inspired the vocation of other young women of her village. In 1842 they
              founded a Pious Association for propagation of virtue through example, instructions and prayer. Following
              the example of Mary, the first handmaid of the Lord, Katharina chose her community to be called as Poor
              Handmaids of Jesus Christ. Urged by the “inner voice” she wanted to build a “little house”. Despite the
              political tensions and meagre earning of a few pennies, her thought of the “little house” urged by her trust
              in God and self-determination to accomplish what God had designed for her. Thus, her dream was materialized
              and she nursed the sick of her village and in which she provided a home for a widow and eight orphans.
              <br><br>
              On August 15, 1851, Katharina received the necessary approval of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum,
              to form the ‘Pious Society’ into a religious Congregation. On the 15th of August of the same year, Katharina
              and four like-minded women pronounced their vows at St. Boniface parish Church in Wirges, before the Bishop
              thus founding the Congregation, the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ. This was the first religious
              Congregation to be established in the young diocese of Limburg, in Germany. Soon many “little houses” spread
              as she responded to the needs of her time. Mother Mary Katharina led her community for 37 years, personally
              encouraging the 2000 sisters who joined her charitable group during her lifetime.
              <br><br>
              <b>Today the Congregation continues its ministry and mission in the spirit of Blessed Mary Katharina in
                Germany, England, the Netherlands, USA, India, Brazil, Mexico, Kenya and Nigeria.</b>

            <p style="text-align:left;padding: 0 40px;">
  
              It was a time of renewal and change in the Church. The second Vatican Council was about to Start. Mother
              Herluka Bierbaum was elected as mother General of the Congregation of the PHJC in the 16th General Chapter
              in Germany in the year 1960. As a person of vision and insight, she led the Congregation through rough and
              difficult times of the post Vatican period. <br>

            <img src="/images/our congregation/history2.JPG" style="padding:10px 25px " alt="" width="30%" ALIGN="right"/>
            <p style="text-align:left;padding: 0 40px;text-align: justify;">
  
              During her time of her Leadership, Mother Herluka had a Providential meeting with Msgr. Kurian
              Vanchipurackal, of the Diocese of Palai, who was touring through Germany and Holland. In their meeting, they
              talked about the scarcity of vocations in Europe and the abundance of them in Kerala. Mother Herluka, who
              was already dreaming of a mission in other continent, thought it as a ‘Sign from God’ to materialize her
              dream. So, she expressed her willingness and desire to admit Candidates from Kerala to the Congregation.
              <br> <br>
  
              She got in touch with Rt. Rev. Bishop Sabastian Vayalil, Bishop of Palai. She had heard that Palai was
              overflowing with religious vocations. Bishop Sabastian Vayalil enthusiastically supported this idea and
              assured mother of all possible help. As agreed, upon, by Bishop Vayalil, a company of seven girls were
              selected to send to Dernbach. Their training in India was being supervised by Fr. Kurian Vanchipurackal and
              Rev. Fr. Mathew Madathikunnel. <br> <br>
  
              It was way back in 1963, that the first courageous young women arrived in Dernbach, Germany, desirous to be
              Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ. They were Sr. James Mary Aerimathathil PHJC, Sr. TheresillaKakkanattu PHJC,
              Sr. LellisKunnathutharappel PHJC, Sr. Deepa Thayilkalariammakal PHJC and Sr. Gemma Kappiankal PHJC. <br>
              <br>
  
              In 1969 Mother Herluka Bierbaum and Sr. Fabiola Winand came to India to find a suitable place for the Indian
              Sister to serve their people. The first place they found for this purpose was Dhani, in the Diocese of
              Indore, Madhya Pradesh Circumstances and acquaintances were valuable market in their search for a suitable
              beginning. At this time, Bishop Franz Simons, SVD a native of the Netherlands, was Bishop of the Indore
              Diocese. Also Sr. Fabiola’s closeness to her aunt, Sr. Anna Huberta, contributed to the knowledge that the
              small mission in Dhani was in search of a Congregation to replace the Swiss sisters who currently ministered
              there. <br><br>
  
              Dhani was an Adivasi tribal area, and the people were very poor and uneducated. In this mission station
              there was already a small hospital and boarding school for the children, which were in change of the Swiss
              Sisters to continue their ministry, they were waiting to handover the mission to some other Congregation.
              Seeing the place, Mother Herluka at once felt that it was the “treasure she had been searching for” and that
              God had destined for us. She gave her consent, readily, to Bishop Simon of Indore. Mother Herluka visited
              India more times as she had a very special love for India. She often used to say “Our future is India”. <br>

              One of the 2008, Provincial Chapter proposals, was to initiate the process of Bifurcation of St. Province,
              Indian by 2012. Keeping this in mind, Provincial Leadership formed a committee to Proceed with the necessary
              preparation. To facilitate the proceeding the Leadership contacted Sr. David Delany, CSJ to guide this
              process and she happily agreed. <br> <br>
              The committee also met and discussed this issue and felt the need of involving all the sisters in this
              process. I the Superiors’ meeting, the idea was discussed, and it evoked a very good contribution from all
              the superiors. <br> <br>
              The importance of bifurcation was felt for the need of apostolic effectiveness, growth into a deeper life.
